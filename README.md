# Ragr
The "Dating App" of parties! Enter some information about yourself, and throw a Ragr!


# Well, I broke it.
Of course I went a little overboard for this assignment. But this is also a project I hope to continue, as well, so all is not lost. At bare minimum I proved I know how to use the express and handlebars concepts we've covered (and ironically the app I'm building turned out rather similar to the class activity on the assignment due date Thursday 12/20). Yesterday, I had a nice, functioning MVP, but of course, I had to go and mess around.

## Yep. 
So now, due to my very evidently lacking usage of version control, I have no "deployable" version to give to you. Fret not, however. Clever me, knowing I'm quite often too clever for my own good, foresaw my perceived cleverness as being the ultimate form of naivety. So I took a video of the functioning application. Hopefully, by the time this is being graded all this text will be long gone, written over with more positive news.

## FOR NOW!

#### Notes:
1. Please excuse the rather blunt and (to some individuals) explicit nature of this application and it's questionaire. Most of the options are simply placeholders as I attempt to develop a more comprehensive and accurate method for categorizing users / parties and determine their compatibility. 

2. Because I've got family coming into town, I may be AFK for a day or two. Once that's sorted out, I hope to jump right back in and get the app back up and running. If you'd like to be notified when there is a product you can use and test out, let me know on slack or send an email to zachary.a.rheaume@gmail.com
